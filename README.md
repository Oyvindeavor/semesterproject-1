 This is a website i was tasked for my exam project the client is a museum called "Community Science Museum" And it needs to appeal to All audiences. 
 We were not allowed to use JS so its made using only HTML and CSS. A great deal of care went into it looking nice on all browsers and is responsive. 
 Added slight transitions to make it look smooth. All the pictures have been scaled down depending on screen resolutions and are using .webp formats. 
 Acessibility was kept in check to ensure everyone has a great user experience.
